Q1: 

import React, {useState} from 'react';

function Counter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <>
        <p>Current count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count => count + 1)}>Increment count</button>
    </>
  );
}

Q2: 

Click1: Does nothing
Click2: Throws an error because handleClick1 function is not binded with this.
Click3: Shows an alert with this.name
Click4: Shows an alert with this.name, arrow function doesn't need a binding

Q3:

The test will fail because fn1(stateA) will be [2, 3] and fn1(stateC) will be [1, 3]. So expect(fn1(stateA) === fn1(stateC)).toBeTruthy(); will fail.
